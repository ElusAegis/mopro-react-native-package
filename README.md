 # Mopro React Native Package
 
 This library exposes the native Rust bindings generated by [Mopro](https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro). You get cross-platform mobile proving and verification with a slim, type‑safe JS/TS API.
 
 > Mopro handles circuit compilation, Rust ↔︎ mobile bindings, and multi‑proof back‑ends so you can focus on building privacy‑preserving features.

 
 ## How to Import the Package
 Use a Node.js package manager in your React Native app to install dependencies. For example:
 ```sh
 # npm
 npm install https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro-react-native-package
 # yarn / pnpm
 yarn add https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro-react-native-package
 ```

 Alternatively, you can manually add it to your package.json:
 ```json
 "dependencies": {
  "mopro-react-native-package": "github:zkmopro/mopro-react-native-package",
}
```

## How to Use the Package
Here is an example of how to integrate and use this package

```ts
 import {
   generateProof,
   verifyProof,
   ProofLib,          // enum: 'arkworks' | 'rapidsnark' | ...
 } from 'mopro-react-native-package';
 
 async function main() {
   const zkey = `${RNFS.DocumentDirectoryPath}/multiplier2_final.zkey`;
   const inputs = { a: ['3'], b: ['5'] }; // 3 × 5 = 15
 
   const { proof, publicInputs } = await generateProof({
     zkeyPath: zkey,
     inputs: JSON.stringify(inputs),
     proofLib: ProofLib.arkworks,
   });
 
   const ok = await verifyProof({
     zkeyPath: zkey,
     proof,
     inputs: publicInputs,
     proofLib: ProofLib.arkworks,
   });
 
   console.log('Proof valid?', ok);
 }
 ```

> [!WARNING]  
> The default bindings are built specifically for the `multiplier2` circom circuit. If you'd like to update the circuit or switch to a different proving scheme, please refer to the [How to Build the Package](#how-to-build-the-package) section.<br/>
> Circuit source code: https://github.com/zkmopro/circuit-registry/tree/main/multiplier2<br/>
> Example .zkey file for the circuit: http://ci-keys.zkmopro.org/multiplier2_final.zkey<br/>


## Running on a real device

Since this is a native module, you’ll need to use Expo's build commands to run it on a device.
We’ve included an example app in the example folder to help you get started and test:

```sh
cd example
```

### iOS

To run on a connected iOS device:

```sh
npm run ios:device
```

### Android

To run on Android:

```sh
npm run android
```
 
## How to Build the Package

### iOS

Follow the instructions in the [`mopro-swift-package` README](https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro-swift-package?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-build-the-package) to build the package, then run `npm run ios:device` again.

### Android

Follow the instructions in the [`mopro-kotlin-package` README](https://github.com/zkmopro/mopro-kotlin-package?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-build-the-package) to build the package, then run `npm run android` again.
